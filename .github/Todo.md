- the add encrypted drives to dmenu script did not work right after i ran the playbook on a fresh install. the curly braced placeholder was not replaced with the actual values for the disk/by-uuids. after editing the values manually mounting works, however afterwards the dmenu entries in the script still show the drive as [unmounted]. analyze why and fix this.
